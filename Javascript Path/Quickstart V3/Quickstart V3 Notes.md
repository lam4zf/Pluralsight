## Intro to Project
- This course will cover objects.

## Lesson 1: Objects
- An _object_ is a collection of _properties_, which are described in the form of _key/value_ paris.  We can use objects to model "things" using code.
- An object for coffee looks like this:
```javascript
var myCoffee = {
	flavor: "espresso",
	temperature: "Hot",
	ounces: 32,
	milk: false
};

console.log(myCoffee.ounces);
```
