# H1 What is JavaScript?
- JavaScript has nothign to do with Java.  It pulled inspiration from the stucture, but it was named Javascript as a marketing ploy to take advantage of the popularity of Java.
- Created in 1995 by Netscape to create products and applications that run in the browser.
- It is primarily *client side*.  It only needs a browser to run.
- While it was originally designed as a scripting language, it is actually a fully featured language.

# H2 What can we do with JavaScript?
- Can be a ssimple as small enhancemnts like infinite scrolling.
- Parallax (parallax.js)
- Games in the browser
- For the "IoT": robots, wearable tech, and more
- Full applications (the Youtube app for Playstation built on AngularJS).

# H1 Hello World: Writing Your First JavaScript
- Spacing doesn't matter
- `alert()` - just a popup
- `confrim()` - popup with the option to cancel
- `prompt()` - popup that can take input
```javascript
console.log(2+2);
console.log(2-2);
console.log(1234*1234);
console.log(234512/123);
console.log(8%3);
```

# H1 Intro to Operators
- Basically, JavaScript can do math.  nothing new here
```javascript
console.log(2+2);
console.log(2-2);
console.log(1234*1234);
console.log(234512/123);
console.log(8%3);
```

#H1 Understanding the Console
- gives feedback like messages, errors, and warnings, and allows you to test additional code with JavaScript that is currently running on the page.
- Add statements to print to the console from a js file or do it straight in the console itself.
```javascript
console.log("Hello world!");
console.warn("warning!!!");
console.error("ERROR!!!");
```
